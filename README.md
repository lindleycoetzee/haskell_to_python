# haskell_to_python
handbook for "translating" haskell code to python code and hopefuly more

In this handbook, I will attempt to convert haskell code to python. I have been coding part time with python for over 3 years now and I am looking to take on Haskell. The main reason is to hopefully develop dapps on the Cardano blockchain.  

The way I am attempt to write this handbook will be as follows:
* Read “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” by Miran Lipovaca
* Learn to code in haskell
* Have haskell code with “translated” python code

For ease of reference I will name my chapters the same as “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!”'s chapters. This book not meant the leach off of “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” but to be an open, free guide for anyone who is looking to make the transition from python to haskell. I hope this handbook can achieve that.
