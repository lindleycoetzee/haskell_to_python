# haskell_to_python
## A handbook for "translating" haskell code to python code and hopefuly more.

In this handbook, I will attempt to convert haskell code to python. I have been coding part time with python for over 3 years now and I am looking to take on Haskell.

The way I am attempt to write this handbook will be as follows:
* Read “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” by Miran Lipovaca - http://learnyouahaskell.com/
* Learn to code in haskell
* From haskell code “translate” code to python code

This book assumes the following :
* you have already installed the haskell platform and python version 3+ on your machine;
* you already have a text editor and/or IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for haskell and for python; and
* you know how to run python code from the command promt and from an text editor or IDE.

This book is not meant the leach off “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” but to be an open, free guide for those who are coming from a python background and want to learn some haskell. I hope this handbook can achieve that. 

I am not an expert so please feel free to reach out to me if you find any mistakes @ lindleylawrence@gmail.com.
