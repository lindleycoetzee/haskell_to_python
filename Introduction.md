# haskell_to_python
handbook for "translating" haskell code to python code and hopefuly more

In this handbook, I will attempt to convert haskell code to python. I have been coding part time with python for over 3 years now and I am looking to take on Haskell.

The way I am attempt to write this handbook will be as follows:
* Read “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” by Miran Lipovaca
* Learn to code in haskell
* Have haskell code with “translated” python code

This book assumes the following :
* you have already installed the haskell platform and python version 3+ on your machine; and 
* you already have a text editor for haskell and for python

This book not meant the leach off of “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” but to be an open, free guide for anyone who is looking to make the transition from python to haskell. I hope this handbook can achieve that. 

I am not an expert so please feel free to reach out to me if you find any mistakes.
