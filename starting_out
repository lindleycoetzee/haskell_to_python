In this handbook, I will attempt to convert Haskell code to python. I have been coding part time with python for over 3 years now and I am looking to take Haskell. The main reason is to develop dapps on the Cardano blockchain.  
The way I am attempt to write this handbook will be as follows:
•	Read “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” by Miran Lipovaca
•	Learn to code in haskell
•	Have haskell code with “translated” python code

Here we go.

Basic arithmetic

haskell
ghci> 12 + 10
22
ghci> 2 * 17
34
ghci> 1441 – 41
1400
ghci> 10 / 8
1.25

python
>>> 12 + 10
22
>>> 2 * 17
34
>>> 1441 – 41
1400
>>> 10 / 8
1.25
